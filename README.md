* Explain version control.
Version control is like a time machine for your code. It tracks changes, allowing you to go back to earlier versions, collaborate with others without conflicts, and keep a history of your project's development.

* Explain difference between git and github.
Git is a version control system that runs on your local machine, tracking changes in your project, while github is a platform that hosts git repositories, facilitating collaboration and providing additional tools like issue tracking.

* List 3 other github alternatives.
3 other github alternatives include;
- GitLab

Git fetch downloads changes from a remote repository but doesn't automatically merge them into your current branch, while git pull downloads changes and automatically merges them into your current branch.
